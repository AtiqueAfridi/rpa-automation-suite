# RPA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Practice Repository**! This repository serves as a personal workspace for experimenting with and mastering RPA concepts using **Python, Selenium, and other automation tools**.

## 🚀 Project Objectives
- Develop and refine **RPA workflows** for automating repetitive tasks.
- Experiment with **Selenium, PyAutoGUI, UIPath, Robocorp**, and other automation frameworks.
- Implement real-world automation scenarios like **web scraping, data entry, and form handling**.
- Follow **best practices** for maintainable and scalable automation code.
- Explore **headless automation**, **OCR integration**, and **AI-driven RPA enhancements**.

## 📌 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** – Core programming language for automation scripts.
- **Selenium** – Web browser automation.
- **PyAutoGUI** – GUI automation (mouse & keyboard control).
- **UIPath / Robocorp** – Low-code RPA platforms.
- **BeautifulSoup & Scrapy** – Web scraping.
- **Tesseract OCR** – Text recognition from images.
- **Pandas & OpenPyXL** – Data processing and Excel automation.
